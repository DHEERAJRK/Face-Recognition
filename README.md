# Face-Recognition-using-LBPH-and-HaarCascde

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, Local Binary Patterns Histogram, HaarCascade Classifier.
Project Description: a) Used for recognizing the different faces, it can be used for security purposes.
b) Combined HaarCascade Classifier & LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) for easy and accurate recognition. 
c) HaarCascade was used for detecting the faces and LBPH was used for recognizing purposes.
